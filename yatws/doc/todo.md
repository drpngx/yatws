# Test
- test DateOrMonth for options/futures query
- test if a future can be defined solely by the month (place order)
- rustify wsh date strings
- error in a parse with a req_id does not call the handler
- use ..default() in Contract constructors
- the error mux should keep a hash of requests and we should unify the order id and req id space
- positions hashtable with options
- refactor to parse/write contract details using a single function instead of duplicate code
- clarify the `_opt` functions in the protocl decoder

# features
